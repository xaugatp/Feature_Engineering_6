    "   - The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "   - A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship, a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, and a value close to 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "   - In this case, if the Pearson correlation coefficient is positive, it suggests that there is a tendency for higher values of one variable (exercise hours) to be associated with higher values of the other variable (BMI), and vice versa.\n",
    "   - The closer the coefficient is to 1 (positive), the stronger the positive linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient**:\n",
    "   - Spearman's rank correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables.\n",
    "   - Unlike Pearson correlation, Spearman's rank correlation does not assume that the relationship is linear. It looks at the rank order of the values instead.\n",
    "   - Spearman's rank correlation coefficient also ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "   - A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship, a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative monotonic relationship, and a value close to 0 indicates no monotonic relationship.\n",
    "   - In this case, if the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is positive, it suggests that there is a tendency for higher values of one variable (exercise hours) to be associated with higher ranks of the other variable (BMI), and vice versa.\n",
    "   - The closer the coefficient is to 1 (positive), the stronger the positive monotonic relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After interpreting the correlation coefficients, you can make conclusions about the relationship between exercise hours and BMI in your sample of adults. For example, if both coefficients are positive and close to 1, it suggests a strong positive relationship between exercise hours and BMI, meaning that individuals who exercise more tend to have higher BMI."
